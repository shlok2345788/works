                A geniue hero of indian side is rohit sharmaIndian captain Rohit Sharma has opened up on his viral stump-mic conversations with the Indian players during a live match, admitting that he never did it deliberately. Rohit mentioned that he didn't have any favorite lines, and added that his usual conversations with the fielders were recorded due to his fielding position in the slips.

                While England's Bazball failed to entertain the Indian fans in the ongoing 5-match series,
                 one thing that remained in the limelight was Rohit's stump-mic chatters. In the 4th Test match,
                  he had scolded Sarfaraz Khan for not wearing a helmet while fielding at a silly point In his Mumbaikar

                   hilarious comments on the field. The skipper left the fans in awe of him, not just with his batting
                    prowess, but with his on-field antics as well.
